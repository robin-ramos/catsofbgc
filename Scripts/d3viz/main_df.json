She was rescued from the streets all the way from Bulacan. I say that cat lives matter. And that there is beauty beyond breed. There is more meaning to adopt or rescue a cat or dog as compared to buying from a pet store. I am speaking from experience. \nI am happy that there is a growing number of people who are already adopting and rescuing from the streets here in the Philippines. It\u2019s such a norm in \u201cfirst\u201d world countries like Australia. It is my dream that our country will also embrace this. Hoping it will start this lunar new year, \u201cthe year of the dog\u201d. I say again, \u201cCat Lives Matter\u201d. I am hoping and praying that the missing #CatsofBGC be found. And that everyone will learn from this unfortunate event. \n1. Cats are not pests\n2. There is already the Animal Welfare Act in the Philippines. RA 8485 with amended RA 10631 with emphasis to consequences when you violate this law. \n3. The most humane way of controlling cat [and dog] overpopulation is TNR. Contact Local Animal Welfare groups like CARA and PAWS for more information. \n4. As a result of TNR, these Spayed and Neutered Cats in the community will protect us from rodents, cockroaches, and snakes. They are the \u201cnatural\u201d pest control. \n5. Education is still the answer. Ignorance is never an excuse, most specially to our Laws. \n#southiegurl #cara #caravolunteer #animalwelfare #animalwelfareadvocate #vegan #fortheanimals #adoptdontshop #rescued #beautybeyondreed #cats #dogs","time":"2018-02-21","platform":"ig"},"79":{"link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/BfdXqfolV-V\/","text":"grabe I knew it those cats are not missing #catsofbgc.

I need to recall what happened and on top of that, the #CatsOfBGC issue broke out. I'm feeling a tightness in my throat ever since Saturday. We lost Mari (Mari-chu as well call her) on a Saturday afternoon.\n\nWe had a follow up check-up last Wednesday (14Feb). The vet commented on the improvements and had us continue with the medication. She also increased her food intake. We feed her using a syringe. Friday evening, she ate a little. We just thought that maybe she had too much food during the afternoon feeding. Saturday morning came and she has no appetite. She started to breathe heavily and we immediately went to the vet. We had her confined hoping she will pull through. We got a message in the afternoon. I didn't want to touch my phone. It's either another bad news about the BGC cats or it's about Mari. Both ended in a bad way. \nI feel inadequate, angry, sad... I want to blame someone. I want to blame the person who abandoned her, who left her exposed that lead to her sickness. I'm also angry that the Cats of BGC were taken away by pest exterminators. The world is getting smaller, people and corporations are getting greedier, and smaller creatures like Mari are the casualties.\n\nStill, always look for the helpers.

Sadly, no other cats were there so he decided to bring her home. I remember this first photo he sent along with the message \"look what I got!\" Our little girl Amelia is one of those BGC cats. Look at how she evolved into this beautiful creature that gives us joy everyday. I wish this kind of joy for everyone. It cannot be explained and maybe non-pet lovers will never understand.\n\nLet us try to open our homes to these wonderful creatures.

But first, let me introduce this place. .\n\nIt's located somewhere past The Heritage Park, left turn along Bayani Road. \"PUSSY CATS' KINGDOM,\" the little blue made-up house said. This photo was taken when @bjanbernabe and I traveled by foot (morning \"workout\") last November 2017. Whoever set that up there, we have no idea. Wala namang naka-bantay. There was a note written that said, \"Hindi iponan ng mga pusa. 'Wag maglagay ng maliliit na pusa, di pa kumakain.\" We found two cats finding shelter from the 9am heat. It's a cute and nice home for these stray cats, but not the best and proper one thay they can have.\n.\n\nThe situation of the cats in BGC is almost the same story, except there's no blue made-up house. We were very fond of them, kaya lagi namin silang dinadaanan after our morning jogs. There was \"Bungo,\" with his black markings on the face forming like a skull. This brown-streaked, playful cat I would've named Darth Invader (LOL; also coz it just invades private space). A pregnant cat that we haven't named yet (would've loved to name her Fiona coz that sounds like a pretty cat, doesn't it).\n.\n\nThey are super friendly and they love receiving lambing from people who pass by. But they do not *really* belong there. They are all stray cats, roaming around someone else's property. I'm not defending Shangri-la's action. And that's not the point of this long post (thank you for reading up to this point btw). Maybe this issue puts light to the overwhelming number of stray cats. If you want to help out these cats (and more), please #AdoptNotShop. There are a lot of kindhearted groups and organizations that tend to stray cats until a parent decides to take them home (my friend @fatimoir handles @catsforadoptionph). A lot of street cats need shelter and love. Instead of burning down Shangri-La the Fort, take a lovely feline, or two, home. Go back to the root of the problem: they need shelter. Be their home. .\n\nSide note: I LOVE cats but I can't take them home. Maybe when I finally live on my own.","time":"2018-02-19","platform":"ig"},"166":{"link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/BfX-dhiFtrY\/","text":"Well, that escalated quickly! Hoho.

You are unethical, uncompassionate, selfish and have no regard for life. It is ironic that you are in the hospitality field and your hotel's name means Utopia -where everything is beautiful, peaceful and harmonious- yet how you treated those poor innocent cats is the complete opposite. Is that what you call social responsibility? Most of those cats have probably lived in BGC longer than you have yet you got the audacity to displace them from the park which isn't even your property? Wow! Shame on you! Those cats are even well taken care of, vaccinated, spayed and neutered; you didn't consider how the people who take care of them would feel. I am reading a lot of comments from BGC residents and those who work there about how fond they were of the cats, how they bonded with them, they even feed them regularly and now they're heartbroken with the disappearance of their feline friends; I no longer live in BGC but my heart breaks for them too. \ud83d\udc94 If it's any consolation, I'm touched with the outpouring love and concern people from all walks of life -most of which are professionals, executives, expats- are showing not just to those poor BGC felines but all cats in general. On a lighter note, I think dagdag pogi points mga professional, good-looking men who speak up for the cat's rights. Haha. Compassion is \ud83d\udc95. #justiceforBGCcats #animalwelfare #catsofbgc #animalrights #catsofinstagram #catlovers #shangrila","time":"2018-02-19","platform":"ig"},"167":{"link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/BfX9fZxBCK6\/","text":"The kind of people we are is reflected in how we treat our stray animals, and I feel that some of us have gone to the lowest low by taking the stray cats of BGC away, getting rid of them like their lives don\u2019t matter.

Those cats are well taken cared of by volunteers, residents, office workers and even strangers who visit BGC. Most of them are fixed and are fully vaccinated.

The cats will be returned, though--which means they are still in danger of being taken to the pound where they will be euthanized if unclaimed. Please consider adopting and\/or getting in touch with your community admins to propose humane solutions to the stray cat population. -------------\nRepost from @catsofbgc \nLast Friday, some of the new (and very hard-to-catch!) #CatsOfBGC received something from CARA Welfare Philippines (@carawelfareph ) that will keep their lives happier, healthier and longer: the gift of spaying\/neutering! \nSee, spaying\/neutering don't just prevent cats from breeding and further overpopulating. When you spay\/neuter your kitty, you're preventing it from: acquiring diseases transmitted through mating with other cats, roaming and running away, fighting with other cats, AND spraying smelly urine\/wailing like crazy!! Here are just some of the photos from the TNR (#TrapNeuterRelease) activity made possible by our wonderful friends from CARA. You can even see our spayed\/neutered BGC kitties comforting their inexperienced friends! Truly, that afternoon was filled with love and compassion--from hoomans and kitties alike! \nSince 2000, CARA (Compassion And Responsibility for Animals) has been serving as a non-profit,non-government organization for animal lovers. You may help them save more lives through spaying\/neutering by donating to their cause. Thank you, CARA! Please visit https:\/\/www.caraphil.org\/mainsite\/get-involved\/donate\/ for more details. #AdoptDontShop","time":"2018-01-14","platform":"ig"},"284":{"link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/Bd7OWfglmhh\/","text":"Monsieur Burrito sleeping on his book because he can #monsieurburrito #bgccats #catsofbgc","time":"2018-01-14","platform":"ig"},"285":{"link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/Bd60_70FBtd\/","text":"How long have i grown?? #cheesecatchats #cheese #catoftheday #cat #cats #catsofig #catsofinstagram #kitty #kittycat #kitten #kittensofinstagram #kittens #pet #pets #petsofinstagram #petstagram #scottishfold #animals #animallovers #animal #bigboy #fatcat #cutecats #weekend #sunday #catsofmanila #catsofbgc","time":"2018-01-14","platform":"ig"},"286":{"link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/Bd4oyhjB2Z1\/","text":"Such a graceful cat \u2764\ufe0f #catsofbgc","time":"2018-01-13","platform":"ig"},"287":{"link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/Bd22AxDlRCf\/","text":"\"Couch yoga\"\n\n#cats #catstagram #catsofbgc #cat #bnw #bnwphotography #bnwmood","time":"2018-01-12","platform":"ig"},"288":{"link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/Bd2Tp_Qgpb0\/","text":"Things I should do more of this year; help more cats.

These are stray cats, and I always wonder how they can survive. Unexpectedly, we saw this guy (we called him Mr. Ochi) feeding them and seems they know him for awhile. Me and my bestfriend @allaboutlexa_  decided to stopped-by and talked to him. For almost 30-minutes, we learned that he is homeless, but currently looking for a job, and also feeding these stray cats because he is worried for them. It was a very meaningful 30-minutes and we learned how humble he is and his great compassion for them.\n\nI am thankful that someone is taking care of them. He said he is relying to good people who give him catfoods, and even some good people also feeding them but not enough. \nCan you believe that there are 34 stray cats now in Bonifacio High Street, and they are already part of this beautiful community?! How awesome is that!\n\nBut then these cats needs help. If you happen to visit @bonifaciohighstreet , please bring some catfoods for them. They are loving creatures, and  part of our community. Also if someone out there have a good heart to help Mr. Ochi to get a job, please do. He have a good heart.\n\nHe have nothing, but still trying to give something for these cats. \nA person like him who have this great compassion is someone worth your time. \nMore stories on my blog soon. *\n*\n*\n*\n#catsofBGC #cats #catlover #lifestyle #kol #bonifaciohighstreet #bonifacioglobalcity #bgc #manila #love #compassion #help #catlovers #sweetcatclub #ilovecats #instacat #catday #internationalcatday #happyinternationalcatday #catgram #catsofinstagram #truestory #BGCitizen #exploreBGC @catsofbgc","time":"2017-11-02","platform":"ig"},"410":{"link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/BasqSGRj_1C\/","text":"Cats are known to prefer running water over water in a bowl.

He gave me cat food to feed that cat, and she noticed me from then on; not until the cat food ran out, she doesn't care about me again.\n\nIn these photos, she was that far from me, and a second after taking her picture, she noticed me behind her, then started meowing. She knew I got food for her so I put down my bag on one of the nearby outdoor seats, and handed her some pellets. Look how close she was in the second photo after handing her the food~\n\nSometimes, or maybe most of the time, I find cats interesting, fierce, and lazy. Interesting because they do not have to impress people to love them. Fierce because cats around our residential area eat birds (sorry for this brutality--animal food chain is real), and their claws and sharp teeth make me see them as fierce creatures however small they are. Lazy because... They just are.\n\nSorry, I'm just sharing my love for cats. \ud83d\ude02 sharing some random stories with you.

I do wish the admin of this complex can be educated with #TNR and the cats can live here like community cats in Serendra or Greenbelt. I'm glad though  that there are also people who left food and water bowls for these babies. If some of these babies can get adopted out (I almost took home one!)

On our continued high street adventures (it's very close and a good place to walk and T. doesn't have a car because in this part of town you really don't need one and also the traffic here is vaguely terrifying), we have now encountered the same little cat family three nights in a row. I think that means they're ours, at least for the duration of my stay. \ud83d\ude0a A few kittens and a mom cat, who is VERY pregnant again. I don't know for sure that she's the mom to this particular group of adolescent cats - she seems too young to be on anything other than her first litter, but I mean, a huge population breeding freely...who knows?! Anyway I was up by 7 this morning because of course I was, so I went out to give them some breakfast snacks and to say hi. Mostly they were asleep but they didn't seem to mind the interruption. I wish we could do something to care for the mom cat through the upcoming litter (and then get her neutered!), but T. isn't supposed to have pets in his apartment, and honestly taking on the cat of a nursing mom and babies really is a lot. Sigh. I love having so many cats around but population control is so important. #cats #catsofig #catstagram #catsofinstagram #catsofbgc","time":"2017-02-20","platform":"ig"},"602":{"link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/BQstio5hKl9\/","text":"Such sweet babies.
